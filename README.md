# Duplython

What is Duplython ?
-------------------

Duplython is a simple cli app that can be used to recursively remove duplicates files over a given directory using Python


How does it work ?
--------------------
Duplython underhood is able to detect any duplicate file using **hashing**, each single file whether its image | music | video has a unique hash, so if any two file with duplicate hash, one of them will be removed.


Getting started
------------------
To start using this tool you might wanna clone or download this repository

```bash
$-> git clone https://github.com/ray4ever/Duplython
```

Dependencies
-------------

You don't need to install anything, all the libraries and module used in this tool are found in the Python standard library.


Move into project directory
---------------------------

Now move into the project repository and you will see a script named **app.py** , now move it to the top directory of a folder you would to clean up the duplicates, whether its your music folder , video folder, or disk top directory and then run the script.

```bash
$-> python app.py
```

Duplicates Screaming out
--------------------------
Now once you run the script, the duplicates present in any subfolder of a top directory will be screaming out as a result of script detecting them thus removing their finger print to your disk, adding up more space to store your important files

Issues
-----------

Incase you have any difficulties or issues while trying to run the script
you can raise it on the issues.
